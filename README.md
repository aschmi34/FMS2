# FMS2

Our objective is to create a program to simulate a file management system. The system will be created using tree-structured directories, starting at a root 
directory. The root directory will contain both files and directories. Each subdirectory can also contain both files and directories. Our goal is to 
implement functions to: 

Add a file or directory to the current directory,
Remove a file or directory from the current directory,
Rename a file or directory,
List all files and directories in the current directory,
Navigate through directories,
and Display current directory’s name.

We will simulate a file by representing it with a string containing the name of the file. 
The directory will be simulated using a general node class with two subclasses, one for directories and one for files. The general node class will only
contain the name of the file or directory and a pointer. The subclasses will contain the methods specific to the functions of either files or directories.
